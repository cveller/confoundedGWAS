For the paper "Interpreting population- and family-based genome-wide association studies in the presence of confounding" (Veller & Coop Biorxiv 2023 https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.26.530052):


-- The script crossTraitAssortMate_sameArchitecture.slim produces data for Fig. 2, and simulates cross-trait assortative mating between traits X and Y for 20 generations, followed by random mating for a further 20 generations. The cross-trait assortative mating is sex-asymmetric, with a constant female-male X-Y correlation of 0.2. Traits X and Y are encoded by distinct sets of 500 loci each. In each generation, a population GWAS and a sibling GWAS are performed for traits X and Y across all 1000 loci.

-- The script sameTraitAssortMate.slim produces data for Fig. 3, and simulates random mating for 150 generations, then same-trait assortative mating for traits X for 20 generations, followed by random mating for a further 20 generations. The same-trait assortative mating involves a constant female-male correlation of 0.2 for trait-X among mating pairs. Trait X is encoded by 1000 loci evenly spaced throughout the (autosomal) genome. In each generation, a population GWAS and a sibling GWAS are performed for trait X across all 1000 loci.

-- The script crossTraitAssortMate_diffArchitecture.slim produces data for Fig. 4, and simulates random mating for 150 generations, then cross-trait assortative mating between traits X and Y for 20 generations, followed by random mating for a further 20 generations. The cross-trait assortative mating is sex-asymmetric, with a constant female-male X-Y correlation of 0.2. Trait X is encoded by 100 loci, while trait Y is encoded by 1000 loci; these sets of loci are distinct, and evenly interspersed amongst each other. Effect sizes at the loci are chosen randomly, such that the genic variances of the two traits are the same. In each generation, a population GWAS and a sibling GWAS are performed for traits X and Y across all 1100 loci.

-- The script populationStructure_and_Admixture.slim produces data for Fig. 5, and simulates two genetically divergent subpopulations, which are isolated for the first 50 generations that we track, but which then come together to form an admixed population, which we track for a further 50 generations. Mating is random in each subpopulation and in the admixed population. In each generation, we perform a population-wide and a sibling GWAS for the focal trait, which is encoded by the 1000 loci at which we perform the GWASs. Effect sizes at these loci are randomly chosen at the outset.
